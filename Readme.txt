** The program is a simulation of Self Avoiding Random Walk Pattern
** A s elf avoiding random-walk in a lattice is a path from one point to another that does not visit the same point twice.
** It has applications in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics
** They can be used to model chain-like entities such as solvents and polymers
** It starts at the center and ends at a point on boundary or ends at a dead-point
** A dead point is surrounded by four points that have already been visited
